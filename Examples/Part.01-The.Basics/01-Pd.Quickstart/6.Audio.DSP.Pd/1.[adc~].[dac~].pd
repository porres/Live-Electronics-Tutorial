#X text 32 40 The audio input/output objects in Pd are \, respectively \, [adc~] (from "Analog to Digital Converter") and [dac~] (from "Digital to Analog Converter")., f 55;
#X text 196 102 audio input;
#X text 32 178 The names indicate that Pd considers itself as a digital audio station \, which is nothing but true \, but also indicates that whatever incoming and outcoming audio is analog \, which is not necessarily true., f 56;
#X text 31 352 By default \, [adc~] and [dac~] deal with stereo in/out \, which are numbered as "1" and "2" \, but you can define other channels with the arguments., f 56;

#X text 490 376 Note that the [out~] object automatically turns the DSP On when dragging the slider \, and that it has a toggle for turning the DSP On and Off. The [setdsp~] object from ELSE may also turn the audio on and off with a toggle so audio objects can operate. It also force the audio to be turned on or off when we open the patch. Check its help file and also check [out~] for stereo input., f 58;
#X text 32 244 The fact is that these objects communicate with audio drivers and sound cards in your audio configurations \, so it then depends on whether it has analog and/or digital in/outputs and how many of them. Most audio cards will have analog in/outs and it's in the audio card that the Analog x Digital conversion actually takes place \, not in Pd., f 56;
#X text 470 158 Click and drag the slider. If your system is configured with an audio sound card connected to speakers \, you should hear the oscillator at 440 Hertz!, f 62;
#X text 470 52 The ELSE library \, that you were told to install in the last example (so you should have it already) \, contains the [out~] object \, which is in fact an abstraction (a Pd patch) that includes [dac~]. This is just for convenience and uses the default stereo output configuration (output channels 1 and 2). Check its help file. If only the left inlet is connected \, [out~] addresses it to both outputs., f 62;
#X text 257 519 The [adc~] and [dac~] objects have support for Multi channel signals as the help file describes. A bit more about Multi channels in the next example in this series.;
