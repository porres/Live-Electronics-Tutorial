#X text 46 62 The [allpass.filt~] object from the ELSE library is an
abstraction that stacks many [allpass.2nd~] objects in cascade. This
means it can reach higher orders \, but you need to set the order as
a multiple of 2!, f 55;
#X text 46 127 As we've seen \, at each 2nd order stage \, the filter
distorts one full phsse cycle. The maximum order of this object is
64 \, and you can only set the order when creating the object., f
55;
#X text 46 194 If we sum the input to the filtered signal \, we can
hear the phase cancellation at each frequency point there's a phase
opposition. In this example we have an 8th order filter \, this means
it has 4 phase cancellation frequency points. So it's like having 4
bandstop filters., f 55;
