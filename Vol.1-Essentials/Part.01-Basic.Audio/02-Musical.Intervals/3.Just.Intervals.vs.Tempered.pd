#X text 30 17 Just Intervals are represented by the ratio of integers.
In other words \, they are rational numbers. On the other hand \, a
tempered interval such as the tritone (whose proportion is the square
root of two) cannot be represented by an integer ratio \, and is therefore
an irrational number., f 59;
#X text 30 160 As an example \, the just interval obtained with the
3/2 ratio is that of a Perfect Fifth \, and corresponds to the relationship
between the third and second elements in the harmonic series., f 59
;
#X text 30 321 This is what's more interesting about cents \, being
able to compare intervals to the equal temperament. Try now other just
interval ratios such as major third (5/4) \, perfect fourth (4/3) \,
minor seventh (7/4) and others., f 59;

#X text 30 95 Just Intervals relate to the Harmonic Series \, which
is a series of integers that represent the ratio of harmonics. This
implies that all harmonics are multiples of a fundamental tone., f
59;
#X text 30 226 Now we can compare this interval with the one from the
equal temperament. See the default values to the right \, we load a
3/2 ratio and see that it has about 702 cents. A perfect fifth in the
equal temperament has 7 semitones and 700 cents. So there's a tiny
difference where the just intonation interval is almost only 2 cents
higher., f 59;
