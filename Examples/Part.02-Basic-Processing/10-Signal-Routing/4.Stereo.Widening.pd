#X text 27 120 But first let's understand how we listen. We have two ears pointed to opposite direction. Our brain can perceive when a sound source reaches both of our ears \, and the delay from when it arrives to one ear and the other gives us a cue on where the sound source is located. A good stereo microphone recording places the microphones in a way to achieve this imaging effect., f 61;

#X text 486 71 While we're on the subject \, if you have a stereo track that you sum together into a mono source \, you can have cancelling issues. One way out is to invert or flip the polarity of one of the tracks. This is just multiplying by -1 and deals with cancelling issues., f 55;
#X text 485 148 Conversely \, we can also get one mono input and create a widened stereo effect by inverting the polarity of one of the tracks. See the difference below., f 55;

#X text 27 42 Stereo widening is any technique that increases the perceived stereo width or spread of a signal into the stereo field. Panning is one such technique \, but this example shows you other cheap and dirty tricks to create stereo images from mono sources., f 61;
#X text 27 258 This is a delay trick \, also known as the "Hass effect" \, implemented by simply duplicating a mono signal but delaying one of the outputs. Try delay values from 7 to 21 ms as in the example below \, which is a good range for the haas effect (but you go wilder if you want)., f 61;
