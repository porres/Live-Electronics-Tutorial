#X text 44 70 Before MIDI \, analog synthesizers used (and still use) "Control Voltage" (abbrevated as "CV"). this is the same as saying they are controlled by audio signals \, since audio output is nothing but an alternate voltage current., f 64;
#X text 44 189 In ELSE \, both an impulse or pulse can be considered a trigger \, but in the modular world \, a trigger is mostly an impulse \, which acts like a 'bang' and fires a process like playing a sample \, changing the value of a sequence or triggering a timed envelope. A gate is an on/off switch \, just like a toggle - so in the audioworls it is nothing but a pulse., f 64;
#X text 44 280 The 'proper CVâ€™ is just the process of controlling any parameter with a voltage value. For example \, the cutoff frequency of a filter \, so much like controlling anything in Pd with an audio signal \, but bound to the voltage range in the modular system instead., f 64;
#X text 44 357 Let's start by checking some objects that are relative to these 3 types of control here in Pd., f 64;
