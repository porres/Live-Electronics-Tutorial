#X text 92 529 The [pink~] object allows you to set the number of octaves \, where 1 makes it a single frequency band of noise \, which is plain white noise. For each extra octave \, the bandwidth is split in half and the new octaves are 3dB lower than the previous lower octave. The maximum number of extra octaves is 40 and the default depends on the sample rate \, and it is so that the lowest octave starts around 20hz (a sample rate of 44100 gives us 12 octaves)., f 82;

#X text 93 61 The [pink~] object is a pink noise generator. Unlike white noise \, pink noise has a decay of energy in the higher frequency range. It falls about 3 dB per octave. Compare both below \, check [pink~]'s help file., f 77;
#X text 92 430 [pink~] generating pink noise with the Voss-McCartney algorithm \, where you mix a bunch of band limited white noises (we'll see more about noise band limiting later). A frequency band limited noise has all frequencies within a frequency band from 0Hz to the bandwidth. By adding different band limitded noises with different bandwidths you end up adding more energy in the lower range and we do this so it decays 3dB per octave., f 82;
