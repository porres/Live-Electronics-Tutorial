need a Hann window after the inverse transform. The normalization factor
now is different because of the hann windows \, we need to also multiply
by 0.375 (more details about this are in the next example in this tutorial
series)., f 40;

#X text 45 23 The native objects [ifft~] and [rifft~] perform the inverse
transform \, from the frequency domain to the amplitude domain. This
is \, above all \, a mathematical conversion between these domains.
But since the fourier transform decomposes a signal into sine components
\, you can interpret the inverse transform as an additive synthesis
\, but this is not a good comparison as we'll see., f 48;
#X text 437 105 IMPORTANT: Please realize that the amplitude information
from a FFT analysis doesn't mean the original sound has sine components
that match the harmonic series of that FFT. But this may be the idea
given with the additive synthesis metaphor and that's what problematic
about it., f 62;
#X text 437 188 You just cannot resynthesize any input sound with a
single FFT frame \, this is not how FFT works. If that was it \, it
would only synthesize sounds with that harmonic series'components.
, f 62;
#X text 437 248 How does it do it then? Well \, the initial phase information
is also important! But we know that changing the initial phase of sine
components does not change much \, and it'll still keep the same harmonic
series. Where's the catch then?, f 62;
#X text 438 318 First of all \, FFT resynthesis is much more related
to granulation than additive synthesis! this is the secret. And when
a sound input that does not match the harmonic is analyzed \, each
FFT frame has a different initial phase. Because if we were talking
about a sine component that was a perfect harmonic \, it would fit
right in a frequency bin and the initial phase wouldn't change from
one frame to another., f 62;
#X text 439 432 So this is how the initial phase information ends up
codifying the actual tonal content of the analysis \, and then a granular
overlap is able to recreate the original signal. This should become
clearer when we move on to the practical examples., f 62;
#X text 44 143 Let's first have a look at it from a conversion perspective.
See how the value is converted to and back. It needs a normalization
though. Open the subpatch below to the left for more details. Then
check the sawtooth being transformed to the frequency domain and back
and open the subprach to the right for more details., f 48;
