#X text 43 19 Pd can load files and externals in a patch. You can specify
an absolute directory for that \, which is a complete path \, from
root \, whic is not very convenient., f 60;
#X text 43 72 But Pd automatically searches for these in specific folders
\, so we can use them or folders that are realtive to them instead.
In order of priority \, these folders are \; - A) The folder where
the patch is saved \; - B) User Added Paths (set in Pd => Preferences
=> Path) \; - C) Pd’s Standard Path (a.k.a. the “extra” folder
inside Pd’s Application).;
#X text 43 187 When specifying relative paths \, you can use the prefix
"./" that specifies "this folder" \, which is not needed as it is implicitly
defined when we don't use it. The “../” prefix \, on the other
hand \, refers to the parent directory \, and “../../” is the parent’s
parent directory and so on…, f 60;
#X text 43 267 These can be expanded to subfolders. If you have a prefix
like “files/” (or “./files”) \, Pd searches inside a subfolder
named “files” in A) \, B) and C). Conversely \, something like
“../files” will look in a subfolder named “files” in the parent
patch as relative to A) \, B) and C).;
#X text 513 19 As an example \, we tell Pd to look for a "table.txt"
file and load it into an array. This file is inside a subfolder named
"txt". Since we do in fact have such a file and folder in "A)" \, this
task is done successfuly., f 51;
