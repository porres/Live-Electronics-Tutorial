#X text 68 108 A signal input allows a smooth and continuous change
in the read position. Note however that such changes promote a speed
change. Thinking again of a magnetic tape \, for the read head to move
from one point to another \, its moving speed is sumed to the normal
reading speed of the tape., f 58;
#X text 69 187 But when the read head reaches its destination and rests
there \, only the reading speed of the tape is acting \, this the original
speed is restored. Fool around with the slider below and see how that
happens., f 58;

#X text 70 480 Interpolation:;
#X text 70 504 Since it uses the same interpolation as [tabread4~]
\, the [delread4~] object also ignores the first recorded sample \,
as it is supposed to be a guard point. In practical terms \, the object's
minimum delay is 1 sample (whereas [delread~] can have a minimum delay
of 0).;
#X text 72 625 Up to Pd 0.48-2 \, [delread~] e [delread4~] cannot read
up to the maximum delay line \, but they go up to a block of audio
less. A workaround is to specify a buffer size a block longer than
you actually need., f 58;
#X text 68 12 The [delread~] object only has control input and does
not interpolate \, so it can only read back in a buffer at a specific
sample behind. On the other hand \, the native [delread4~] object can
read in between samples \, with the same kind of interpolation used
in [tabread4~] and accepts signal inputs.;
