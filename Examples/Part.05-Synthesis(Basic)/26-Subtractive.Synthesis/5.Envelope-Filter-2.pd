#X text 317 269 We can use a simpler envelope than an ADSR for the envelope \, just like we can use more complicated ones. In this example we have a very simple envelope that just has a release stage. The [asr~] is used instead of [adsr~] because we don't need the decay and sustain stages for this \, but one could also use [adsr~] by adjusting decay to zero and the sustain point to 1! We still have an [adsr~] envelope for the amplitude., f 37;
#X text 317 452 One could also think about an attack and release envelope for filtering \, but just a release has a nice feel that makes it sound less brigth when releasing the envelope., f 37;
