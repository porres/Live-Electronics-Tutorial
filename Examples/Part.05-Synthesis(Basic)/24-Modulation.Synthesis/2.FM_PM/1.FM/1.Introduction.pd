#X text 27 32 Generally speaking \, modulating a signal means applying
any changes to it. But in the context of computer music and synthesis
\, we're talking about a modulating signal that controls a parameter
\, like the amplitude as we've seen. Let's check now the basic structure
of Frequency Modulation with an oscillator as the modulating signal.

#X text 27 262 The frequency modulation procedure is simple \, just
add the carrier signal to the modulating signal - see the example to
the right. By default \, we have a 400 Hz carrier signal \, a low frequency
of 1 as the modulating frequency and an index of 100 - this means the
modulating signal oscillates between -100 and 100 at every second \,
and the resulting frequency modulating signal varies from 300 to 500
hz. Note that a low frequency modulator generates vibrato like effects
\, but try higher frequencies., f 67;
#X text 27 111 The signal to be modulated is called the "Carrier" -
in the case of frequency modulation \, this can also be called "Carrier
Frequency". Conversely \, we also have a Modulator frequency \, which
is the frequency of the modulating oscillator. The frequency deviation
is controlled by the oscillator's amplitude and is also usually called
"modulation index" but this is theoretically inaccurate. We'll see
later how the index is actually the ratio between deviation and modulating
frequency \, and how that relates to how the modulation index behaves
in Phase Modulation. Just note that until then \, modulation index
here actually means 'frequency deviation'., f 67;
