#X text 34 31 Setting a maximum value of 0 dB is a practice that comes from the usage of "Volume Meters" (VU) in analog audio. This device is calibrated so that 0 dB is the maximum value it can handle without distorting. In digital audio we have the same thing \, but digital distortion is a special type \, known as "clipping"., f 56;

#X text 35 139 The maximum peak amplitude is 1 (0 dBFS). Greater values are "clipped" \, which means they become 1 as that's the maximum representable value. In practice \, we have resulting waves that are a bit square (see below the graphical representation of clipping \, with the [clip~] object and [graph~])., f 56;
#X obj 221 384 clip~ -1 1;
#X text 465 170 See below to the left how [vu] can still represent values over 0 dB \, but note also how they become red \, as a sign of "DANGER"! Or "warning \, this is being clipped"., f 66;
#X text 465 62 Within Pd we can still have values outside the -1 to 1 range. It is in the digital to analog conversion that the clipping occurs. Pd has a native [vu] GUI object that is a kind of VU Meter. It displays RMS and Peak amplitudes \, but it doesn't really perform any signal analysis. Now the [vu~] object from ELSE analyses a signal and outputs both RMS (left outlet) and Peak (right outlet) so we can feed [vu]., f 66;
#X text 465 223 Below \, to the right \, we have other objects from ELSE: [meter~] and [meter2~] \, which are convenient abstractions based on [vu~] and [vu] that automatically performs analysis on the input signals. ELSE also offers [meter4~] and [meter8~] \, which can be used for quadraphonic and octaphonic setups. The [meter2~] \, [meter4~] and [meter8~] object can also take multichannel inputs \, check their help files., f 66;
