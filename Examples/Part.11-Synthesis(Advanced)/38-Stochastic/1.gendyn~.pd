#X text 41 145 The stochastic process affects the reading speed of the waveform (hence the frequency) and also how the points in the waveform change (that is their amplitude and waveform in general). These points can be interpolated with two types (linear and cosine) or not. The original algorithm sets a frequency range \, but the object from ELSE can also operate with a center frequency input \, for which you can set a bandwidth (below it is 100 cents above and below)., f 65;

#X text 42 66 [gendyn~] is based on Xenakis' 'GenDyn' algorithm \, a technique for stochastic synthesis that is based on Brownian motion (a type of random walk). You can go back to Part.04-Control and revise the chapter 20-Stochastic for a basis on stochastic processes and what brownian motion is., f 65;
