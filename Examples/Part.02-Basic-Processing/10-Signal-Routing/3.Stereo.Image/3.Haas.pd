#X text 36 176 First let's understand how we listen. We have two ears pointed to opposite direction. Our brain can perceive when a sound source reaches both of our ears \, and the delay from when it arrives to one ear and the other gives us a cue on where the sound source is located. A good stereo microphone recording places the microphones in a way to achieve this imaging effect., f 61;
#X text 36 284 Hence \, we can create a stereo image of a mono file with a delay trick \, also known as the "Hass effect" \, implemented by simply duplicating a mono signal but delaying one of the outputs. Try delay values from 7 to 21 ms as in the example below \, which is a good range for the haas effect (but you go wilder if you want)., f 61;
#X text 36 71 Stereo widening is any technique that increases the perceived stereo width or spread of a signal into the stereo field. Panning is one such technique \, so is actually balancing and stereo paning \, but there are more. This example and the next one show us a couple of cheap tricks to create stereo images from mono sources. So \, let's start with the Hass effect., f 61;
