#X text 322 475 In this example \, for the sake of simplicity \, we have a fixed cutoff frequency at MIDI pitch '50' (D3 \, close to 150hz) and the maximum modulated cutoff is 100 (about 2.6 Khz)., f 44;

#X text 322 242 We can use a simpler envelope than an ADSR for the envelope \, just like we can use more complicated ones. In this example we have a very simple envelope that just has a release stage with [glide2~]. The [asr~] could also be used instead of [adsr~] because we don't need the decay and sustain stages for this \, but one could also use [adsr~] by adjusting attack/decay to zero and the sustain point to 1! We still have a proper [adsr~] for the amplitude., f 44;
