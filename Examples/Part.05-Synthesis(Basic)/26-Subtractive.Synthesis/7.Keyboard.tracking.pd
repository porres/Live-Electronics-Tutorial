#X text 481 252 We need a reference pitch for the cutoff \, which is 60 in here (middle C). We then get the difference from the input pitch and multiply it by '100' to get the difference in cents and convert it to a ratio that is multiplied by the cutoff., f 67;
#X text 481 316 This factor of '100' is also a percentage of how the frequency deviates according to the pitch input. Hence \, if the track amount is 100% and pitch input is an octave higher than the reference (say 72 if we have middle C as the reference) \, the cutoff shifts by a factor of "2" (also an octave). If the pitch is an octave lower (48) \, the cutoff is also an octave lower. Changing the track amount to zero means simply no tracking. At 50% \, the cutoff frequency is shifted by half than at 100% \, 200% is twice and so on., f 67;
#X text 481 438 You can \, but basically don't need to worry and change the reference keyboard pitch \, but sometimes it might feel unintuitive \, like when you're working a bass sound patch \, playing lower notes that can be \, for instance \, around 2 octaves below that middle C reference. If the cutoff is then 3 Khz you must be aware that it's actually around 3 octaves below (750 Hz). If you feel it's more intuitive \, you can change the reference pitch two octaves below and also have the cutoff equally at 2 octaves below., f 67;
#X obj 132 522 *~ 3000;
#X text 481 557 The same kind of adjustment needs to happen if you change the track amount. Let's stick to the same example we had with a C4 reference and 3 Khz with 100% track amount \, but playing something two octaves below (C2). If we change the track to 25% \, then C2 is not 2 octaves below anymore \, but instead we have an interval that is 1/4 of that. Hence \, it drops by a tritone (falling at around 2.12 Khz). Now \, if we want the same character as before we need to drop the cutoff by an octave plus a tritone (to about 1060 Hz) \, so when you play C2 you get the same 750 Hz cutoff. Again \, you may wanna change the reference pitch if you think it's more intuitive., f 67;
#X text 481 188 In short \, keyboard tracking changes the cutoff depending on the input note. Hence \, you can make lower notes sound less bright than higher note (as is common with acoustic instruments) instead of having the same profile for all notes., f 67;
