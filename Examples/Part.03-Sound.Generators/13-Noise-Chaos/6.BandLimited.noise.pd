#X text 20 17 We can limit the frequency band of a noise source with downsampling as with the [downsample~] external previously first presented in the "decimator" example. Another possibility is to use a "sample and hold" unit \, as we'll see in the next section. This is useful for extracting or generating random values at signal rate \, since noise generators are also random number generators - specially \, [white~] or [noise~] is a plain random number generator., f 72;

#X text 20 124 Nonethelees \, in this section \, we'll focus in downsampling in order to change the sound quality. In other words \, for sound generating purposes \, and not random/stochastic control. Let's start with [white~] \, which has energy equally distributed over the whole spectral range. Let's listen and see what happens when we downsample. We can hear artifacts from aliasing \, since we're reducing the sample rate \, but the energy is still present throughout the spectrum. We can see dips in the spectrograph when we use half or one fourth of the sample rate more clearly \, even more if we have the interpolation mode on. This shows us that the spectral image gets "mirrorred" and copied., f 72;
