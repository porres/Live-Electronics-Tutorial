#X text 27 188 In this example \, the frequency of five oscillators are modulated by independent ramp noise channels. Similarly \, the amplitude is also modulated by independent noise generators. Note that modulation is the topic of the next chapter., f 56;
#X text 27 63 The [sine~] object from ELSE library is an oscillator that take and generate multichannel signals. As such \, you can consider it also a bank of oscillators and you can perform hard sync \, frequency and phase modulation \, which isn't possible in the previous oscillator bank options. Check it help file for more details. Please note that ALL oscillators from ELSE are multichannel aware \, so you can do the same with all of them., f 56;
