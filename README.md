This is a didactic project developed for Pure Data (or just "Pd", a.k.a. "Pd vanilla" distribution). It was developed for version 0.49-0 and should work on later versions­ - download Pd at <http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html>. The example patches only work for Pd Vanilla and are not compatible to other distributions (such as Pd-Extended / Purr Data). They also rely heavily on the download of the "ELSE" library. This particular version of the tutorial depends on ELSE 1.0 beta 15! You can download ELSE directly via Pd, just go for Help => Find Externals and search for 'else' - check: <https://github.com/porres/pd-else/> for more details. Also Access <http://puredata.info> for several links/tutoriais on Pd. The official Pd mailing list is found here: <http://lists.puredata.info/listinfo/pdlist>. 

This work started in 2008 as a textbook for a computer music course. In 2009, the author presented a paper about it in the 3rd International Pure Data Convention. Currently, the work is divided into two volumes and solely presented as example patches that the author uses for courses and workshops. The plan now is to write a book accompanied by these examples. Originally developed in brazilian portuguese and for Pd Extended 0.42-5, this has just been translated to english and ported to rely only in objects from the ELSE external library.

This is still in the early drafts from the first translation round. Many typos and mistakes may exist. This work is now depending on the softare development in the ELSE library to include more examples. This library is still in beta stage and until a final version is out, some objects may have a change in functionality or even be deleted. If so, future updates of this material will reflect the changes.  

This tutorial presents electronic music theory and practice for newbies, dummies, enthusiasts and also experts, without prerequisits. The choice of using Pure Data is its accessibility and also because it is considered a powerful didactic tool to present the topics of the Live Electronics / Computer Music tutorial.
