#X text 37 53 In modular synthesis \, a VCA is a "Voltage Controlled Amplifier" \, which means that the amplifier is controlled by an audio signal \, since audio in the analog world is a voltage signal. So when you have a voltage signal controlling something you have 'CV' (control voltage). Here in Pd we see that the VCA can be nothing but a [*~] object. Alternatively \, we can use [dbgain~]. Here's another option \, the [vca~] object and its MERDA version., f 73;

#X text 35 160 [vca~] is a mono (one in/out) that \, for convenience \, can sum multichannel connections. You also have a general gain compensation and a right output to feed a [vu] object. Yeah \, there's not much different than just using [*~]., f 73;
#X text 232 493 <-- the [vca.m~] MERDA version includes a meter GUI and a gain master adjustment 0.1 to 10, f 24;
