#X text 77 131 In this example \, in order to show how an allpass filter
can affect the sound \, we sum a noise input to the filtered output
\, which cancels frequencies by phase opposition \, rather like a bandstop
filter., f 62;
#X text 61 457 The resonant frequency is the point at which the pahse
is shifted to 180ยบ \, so it is the frequency point we have a full
phase cancellation. This is also considered a kind of resonant filter
because the the steepness of phase distortion is determined by the
Q parameter. In the context of this example \, where it acts like a
bandstop filter \, it is like the Q parameter controls the bandwidth
of the band rejection., f 69;

\, only the phase. This filter will be better presented in a later
