#X text 33 19 AUDIO BLOCK:;
#X text 33 44 For the CPU to not compute every sample one at a time
\, audio signals are usually processed in chucks \, or in a "block".
This is also called the vector or buffer size \, and can be specified
in number of samples or in ms. The standard in Pd is a block of 64
samples! The [blocksize~] object from ELSE reports the current block
size in the patch.;
#X text 29 215 LATENCY:;
#X text 32 235 Latency is the time it takes for an audio process to
come out. Within any audio application \, the latency depends mostly
on the block size and sample rate. The 64 block size then can represent
a lower latency if the sample rate is higher. At 44.1 Khz \, this is
about 1.45 ms \, but a sample rate of 88.2 khz would be half of that.
See below how the [blocksize~] object can also report the block size
in ms and how to calculate that as we've seen before.;

#X text 103 585 standard block size:;
#X text 497 87 See also [print] \, the control version of this object.
To reinforce the difference between audio and control objects \, not
how the [print] object prints ininterruptly when requested \, but [print~]
only operates when the DSP is on., f 63;

#X text 33 508 The block size is always 64 samples for [adc~] and [dac~]
\, but we can change the block size with the native [block~] object.
Despite being redundant \, we have this object below setting a block
size of 64 samples.;
#X text 498 281 Changing the block size affects ist containing window
and subpatches. We usually do this in a subpatch so it only affects
that subwindow (and possible further subpatches). One reason to do
this is not to have conflicts with [adc~] and [dac~] objects in the
patch's main window., f 63;
#X text 497 361 In this tutorial we use [block~] to perform one sample
feedbacks (that is a block of audio with only one sample) and to perform
FFT analysis (with block much larger than 64 samples). A larger block
promotes more internal latency in the patch \, which is equal to "blocksize"
minus 64 (we'll see how that works later on when dealing with FFT).
The [block~] object can also locally change the sample rate and we'll
see this in a bit., f 63;
#X text 497 48 The [print~] object prints the whole block of audio
in Pd's terminal window when it receives a bang. Check it below.,
f 63;
#X text 497 490 The [switch~] object has the exact same functions as
[block~] but can also turn the audio process on or off locally. This
can be the whole patch or just a subpatch (and its containing subwindows).
This is useful because audio objects will consume CPU power whenever
the DSP is on \, so we can save a little when we're not using it. Now
