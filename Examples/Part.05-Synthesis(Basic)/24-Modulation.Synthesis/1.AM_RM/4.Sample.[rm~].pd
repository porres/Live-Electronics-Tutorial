#X text 38 335 Let's test both the classic AM example and the RM one.
In both cases \, the side band frequencies are created for each sine
wave component in the carrier signal., f 71;

#X text 38 83 Actually \, much of what we see as a synthesis technique
topic is actually in respect to a processing technique. In the same
way \, many effect processes are widely used in syhtesis (such as filtering).
Hence \, there's only a fine line between synthesis techniques and
audio processing.;

#X text 38 473 The ELSE library has a simple and straight forward Ring
Modulation object called [rm~]. It uses [osc~] as the modulator and
the frequency input is given as the argument or via the right inlet.
It's worth noting it treats a 0 Hz input as a bypass. This is important
because at 0 Hz \, the oscillator outputs whatever amplitude value
according to that instantaneous phase \, and it won't likely be "1"
\, so you have an undesired gain change., f 71;

#X text 38 19 In this example \, we have a sample as the carrier instead
of an oscillator \, which illustrates the usage of amplitude modulation
as an effects processor rather than a "synthesis technique"., f 60

#X text 38 389 Note how the AM still presents the original sound's
sine components \, but the generated side band frequencies interfere
with them \, so it's more common to see an AM as a tremolo effect (that
we'll see later). The RM example may sound more interesting \, because
it removes the original sine components., f 71;
