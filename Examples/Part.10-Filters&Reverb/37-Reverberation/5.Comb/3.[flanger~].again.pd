#X text 34 65 It's time to look back to [flamger~]. Now you know all about filters and reverberators \, so you can better see flanger for what it is \, a sort of use case for a comb filter/reverberator. Not surprisingly \, we do implement it with a [comb.rev~] object. The [flanger~] external is just a wrapper abstraction around [comb.rev~] with a built-in LFO to control the delay time. Open it and check it., f 53;
#X text 39 499 So now with all the knowledge you currently have \, it's clear that the flanger effect sound like it does because of the comb filtering \, where we hear phase cancelations that generate harmonically spread notches and peaks. We can then contrast it to a Phaser effect \, which has non-uniformly spaced notches in the spectrum, f 54;
