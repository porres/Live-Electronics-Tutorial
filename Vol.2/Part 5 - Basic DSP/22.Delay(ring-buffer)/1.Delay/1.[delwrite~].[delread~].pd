#X text 99 35 The "delay" is the basis of echo and reverberation effects.
We'll see also how they can be used to implement pitch shifters and
later in this tutorial how they are the basis of filters., f 55;
#X text 99 104 The native [delwrite~] object creates a "ring buffer"
\, which is a buffer to continuously record to. You can think of a
magnetic tape in a loop \, so when you record the whole length of the
tape you start recording again from the beggining. This was how the
first delays were designed \, by the way. One head was used to write
and another to read at different length points (the further back \,
the bigger the delay)., f 55;
#X text 99 225 The native [delread~] object \, when named with the
same delay line \, can access the buffer at different length points
(set in ms with the second argument or inlet). Multiple [delread~]
objects can read from the same line defined in [delwrite~]., f 55
